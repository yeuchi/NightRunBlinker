# NightRunBlinker
Simple caution blinking on phone or watch for running in the dark.

# Introduction
As a runner myself, I often run in the dark, morning or night to meet my scheduled milage.  Yeah, there are many great safety products that reflect and emits caution blinking lights.  Since I am already wearing my Polar600 watch and/or strapped to a phone, why not double their usefulness as well ?  

## Configuration
Here are some basic configurable features.
1. select the colors of your toggling screen.
2. select the interval of your blink in milliseconds (this is a software project after all).

## Test
This application is tested on Samsung Galaxy.
