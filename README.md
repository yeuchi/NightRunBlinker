# NightRunBlinker
Simple caution blinking on phone or watch for running in the dark.

# Introduction
As a runner myself, I often run in the dark (morning or night) to meet training schedule mileage.  Yeah, there are plenty excellent safety products with reflectors and/or emits caution blinking.  Since I am already wearing my GPS/heart-rate-monitor watch and/or strapped to a phone, why not double their usefulness as well ?  

## Configuration
Basic configurable features.
1. Colors of the toggling screen.
2. Blink interval in milliseconds (this is a software project after all).

## Phone
MainActivity (configuration) -> BlinkActivity
